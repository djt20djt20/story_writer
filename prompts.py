- **Genre**: What genre(s) does your story fall into? (e.g., Fantasy, Science Fiction, Coming-of-Age, Thriller).
- **Unique Angle**: What sets this story apart? Is there a twist, fresh perspective, or unique element? (e.g., "The story is told from the dog's perspective.")
- **High-Concept Pitch**: A concise, one-sentence summary of the story that hooks interest. (e.g., "A boy and his dog embark on a journey to save their town from an impending disaster.")
- **Target Audience**: Who is the story for? (e.g., "Middle-grade readers who enjoy heartfelt adventures.")

**Your Task:**
Start by describing the core concept in one or two sentences. Then, we'll explore each part of the schema together to refine and expand your story idea.
